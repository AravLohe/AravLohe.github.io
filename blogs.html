    <h1>2-May-2023: Chegg</h1>
    <p>I feel that ChatGPT is going to be a massive change for many business models. Although Chegg is the first to suffer, many other businesses will also began to fall apart. One major business that could fall apart is Google, the search engine portion, as chatGPT can do many of the things google can in a faster and more efficient manner. Chegg will have to reapproach how their website runs as their current scheme of answer sharing is rendered useless with chatGPT. </p>
