      <p style="color:SeaGreen;">I am excited for my first experience with coding and my goal is to be better than I started. <br> The leaves are falling and the day seems beautiful . This was the day I was born. I was born on 11/17/06 at 4:07 pm in Richardson, Texas. My full name is Arav Sachin Lohe. My name means peace. This digital portfolio is imporant to me as I can track the progress and improvements I've made throughout my high school. It will also be valuable insight for colleges and job I want to apply for.   </p>
