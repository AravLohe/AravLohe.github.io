    <hr> <p>1.1 Why do you think Hello world is typically the first program taught to students?<br />
    It is a code which can be written by people with not a lot of expierence.
       <br /> 1.2 How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in? <br/> 
    The syntax can be different as each lagnauge has it's own special set of rules.

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned the creation of the infamous hello world code.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
     <p>I encountered no challenges other than remembering the copy command</p>
     <br />
     <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
     <p>This experience could be improved by making more questions on the different types on syntax on all the lagnauges.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
     <p>I now realize the history of hello world.</p>
