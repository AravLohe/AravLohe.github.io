     <p>1.1 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?<br />
    It is an AND gate. 
       <br /> 1.2 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?
       <br/> They are XOR gate.
    <br />
    <br /> 2.1/2.2 What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder and why?<br/>
    Both are the same since the third input for full-adder is zero.
  
    <br />
    <br /> Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?
    <br/>
    They dont have carries and it is the only place it can be used.
    <br />3.2 Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not<br/>No because the carries change depending on the digit to the left of it so it has to wait for those to process.
    <br /> 3.3  Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?<br/> That means the numbers are large and its a high state <br />

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>Addition and how computers do it</p>
    <br />
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
     <p>I encountered challlenges when trying to understand the content as it wasnt that indepth and there were no questions trying to test my knowledge.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
     <p>This experience could be improved by making more questions cause im not confident in the material and I need to test my knowledge</p>
     <br />
     <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
     <p>I now realize that computers do math similar to humans.</p>
