    <hr> <p>1.1What the similarities between repeat while loop and while loop?<br />
They both repeat continously if true but the repeat while loop is guranteed to execute once and the while loop may not if the statement is false.
       <br /> 1.2What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute? <br/> 
It will be one minimum.
       <br /> 1.3What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?<br/>
       It is to jump back to the beginning of the loop to reevaluate if the loop can continue by determining whether the statement is true or false.
       <br /> 2.1/2,2Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop and vice versa, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.<br/>
       It is possible by evaluating the code after its executed for a repeatwhile and the while loop checks the condition before executing to exit the code.
       repeat-while loop example <br>
       var i = 0<br> 
       repeat <br> 
       print("The value of i is \(i)")<br> 
       i += 1<br> 
        while (i < 3)<br> 

	equivalent while loop example<br> 
	var j = 0<br> 
	while true <br> 
	 print("The value of j is \(j)")<br> 
	 j += 1<br> 
	 if (j >= 3) {<br> 
	 break<br>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned what a repeat while loop is.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
     <p>I encountered challenges in understanding the differences.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
     <p>This experience could not be improved.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
     <p>I now understand that the while loop has a unique subset which is guranteed to run once.</p>
