    <hr> <p>1.1Why is the test executed prior to the loop?<br />
This will tell the CPU whether to continue to the loop or exit and if its inside the loop, then the loop will have already done its job even if not wanted.
       <br /> 1.2What are the similarities and differences compared to the conditional? <br/> 
They follow the same structure of statements leading to jumps but this diagram is more detailed and we understand that there is a starting point which leads to a test/yes or no statement type.
       <br /> 1.3What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? <br/>
       It is to jump back to the beginning of the loop.
