    <hr> <p>1.1How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?<br />
    It is a code which can be written by people with not a lot of expierence.
       <br /> 1.2 Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true? <br/> 
       Consequent means direct consequence and true is the direct consequence while alternate is when it evaluates to.
       <br /> 2.1 Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?<br/>
       Because we want to be able to run the alternate path if a condition is false, otherwise we would always get the consequent outcome even when not wanted.
      <br /> 2.2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?<br/>
      So we can skip over alternative and move into afteralternate.
      <br /> 2.3: Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?
      <br/>
       It runs in sequential order and afteralternative is right after alternative.

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned the use of the Jump instruction.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
     <p>I encountered challenges in the fact that you can have multiple jumps.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
     <p>This experience could be improved by more examples on the jump.</p>
     <br />
     <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
     <p>I now understand more about assembly code and how booleans work in computer logic.</p>
