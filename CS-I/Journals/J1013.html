     <p>1.1 Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction =/?<br/>
       This symbol is used because it represents how both are not true but one can be true for it to be "1" or a true statement.
       
   
    <br /> 2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n? <br/> 
    Each row represents two digits for the two inputs. You multiply by 2 each time you add one more input hence the 2^n <br/>
