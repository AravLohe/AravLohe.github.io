    <p>A software development engineer is someone who helps create software systems. They work closely with all parts of a team including engineers and project managers to help achieve the goal of creating software systems. They must have a strong understanding of coding languages and shells. They also must have many good soft skills in communication, critical thinking, etc. I believe that this would be a good role for me as I have a passion for coding, but the challenge to me would be the fact that I need a lot of knowledge in multiple coding languages and get out of my comfort space which requires me to have the time and patience to learn.

    <p>QA engineers help test the software and assure the quality of it prior to release. They perform tests at different stages in the development of the software to assure success. They execute test cases, testing plans, and also help report defects. The soft skills which are important are collaboration and communication. This is a good role for me because I believe I am good at critiquing but my collaboration skills would need to increase as this is an integral part of this position.

    <p>A product manager is responsible for every member of the group and making sure they are on task and doing their assigned roles. They make sure every part of the group communicates with each other to ensure a successful outcome and are master planners. They  must have very good soft skills in collaboration, communication, decision making, and listening. This role could be good for me as I enjoy leading others and I’m very extroverted, but I am not always good at taking feedback so that would be something I’d need to improve upon.

    <p>A product manager is responsible for being the leader of the product building process.They take to the consumer of said product and take feedback to help improve the product and must have very good soft skills in collaboration, communication, decision making, and listening. They work closely with all the teams and must also be very strong leaders. This role could be good for me as this requires the most creativity and flexibility so it could be fun. However, this would require a lot of time commitment and stress as you must help create the product and have no one directly assigning you tasks.

    <p>A release engineer helps release the software product into production environments. They work closely with the QA engineers to make sure the release runs smoothly. They can also do some of the testing the QA engineer does and it requires a lot of planning. I could be suited for this role as it requires you to be a very good planner. However, the negatives would be that it feels like a very one-dimensional role.
